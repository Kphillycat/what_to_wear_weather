Simply shows you what to wear today based on the weather in your area.

Backstory: When I was younger, I used to wake up really early (around 5am) in order to be the first at school so I could play with the computer and read the computer books. We couldn't afford a computer at home, so the only time I had with computers were at school and I wanted to maximize that time as much as possible. 

So because I got up so early and didn't want to wake up the rest of my family I used to watch the TV on mute. It was mostly cartoons but I still needed to know the weather. I really loved that my local news station would show a picture of how to dress the kids for school everyday. I didn't need the TV audio for that. So all through high school I received all my weather alerts from pictures of kids in jackets or shorts. 

I was able to catch up on some DragonBall Z, Soul Train, and weather within the hour before I headed out. It worked perfectly! I just wanted to create a similar weather app for the web so you can all share the experience I had as a child waking at the crack of dawn and learning how to dress from cartoon children.
